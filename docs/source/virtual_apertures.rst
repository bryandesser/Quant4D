Virtual apertures
-----------------
This mode generates one or more round virtual apertures centered on the aligned
transmitted beam. One interactive virtual aperture is generated, for which the
radius, distance from aligned transmitted beam, and rotation angle can be set
by numerical inputs, sliders, or clicking and draggin the annotation on the
diffraction pattern. Additionally, the user can increase the rotational
symmetry, generating multiple apertures at equal angles around the transmitted
beam. Finally an interactive mirror plane can be added for additional symmetry
operations.
