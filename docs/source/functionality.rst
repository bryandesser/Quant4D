Functionality
=============

`Quant4D` has many useful features to allow you to quickly and intuitively
interactive with 4D-STEM data. Because it is built using MATLAB, it can be
installed on any platform that can run MATLAB, including Windows, Mac, and
Linux. The code is also GPU-accelerated when a GPU is present with enough
virtual memory to hold the entire 4D-STEM dataset plus some overhead for
additional data.
