#. Image Processing
#. Parallel Computing
#. Statistics and Machine Learning

If you already have MATLAB installed, you can check whether or not the required toolboxes are already installed by typing in `ver` to the MATLAB Command Window. If some or all of the required toolboxes are not listed, they can be installed by first running MATLAB with administrator rights. Then, from the **Home** tab, under the **Environment** section, click the **Add-Ons** icon. From the Add-On Explorer, you can search for and install the required toolboxes listed above. More info can be found on the `MathWorks website <https://mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html>`_.
